# DOScraper
A basic web scraper for use on the online digital humanities magazine, the Digital Orientalist.

# DOScraper.py
DOScraper.py is a simple python program based partially on Brad Traversy's blogscraping.py (see: https://gist.github.com/bradtraversy/f2014a236646ff62dccfc9fe5d469ed5). 

It is designed to be used to web scrape the Digital Orientalist, a online digital humanities magazine. It will allow users to acquire some basic information about the content of the site including the titles of articles, the date of their publication, their categorization, a snippet of their content, and the links to the articles. This data will be written to a .csv file.

The program uses bs4 (BeautifulSoup) which should be installed using pip.

# Further Development

There are no plans to develop this further at present. In honesty, the program was little more than an opportunity to experiment with python.
